# Mini-Projects
## Web Development Mini Projects
Welcome to the Web Development Mini Projects repository! This repository is a collection of various small projects that I am working on as part of my learning and practice in web development. The projects included here range from simple UI components to more complex web applications, all built using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially other front-end tools and frameworks.

### Introduction
This repository serves as a personal collection of mini projects developed for practice and learning purposes. Each project is a standalone exercise designed to enhance specific skills related to front-end development. Whether the ideas for these projects come from online tutorials, coding challenges, or course assignments, each project is unique and built with care.

### Project Structure
As this repository will be continuously updated with new projects, the structure is organized as follows:

```bash
/project-name/
│── index.html
│── style.css
│── script.js
│── README.md
│── assets/
│   └── images/
│   └── scripts/
│   └── styles/
│── ...
/next-project-name/
│── index.html
│── style.css
│── script.js
│── README.md
│── assets/
│   └── images/
│   └── scripts/
│   └── styles/
│── ...
```
Each project is contained within its own folder.
Inside each folder, you will find an index.html file along with any associated CSS, JavaScript files, and assets.
Each project may also include its own README.md file with specific details and instructions for that particular project.
### Getting Started
